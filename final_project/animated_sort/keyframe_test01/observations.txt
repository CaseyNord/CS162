when this is played we see a sorted array.  WHY?  If we call the keyframe before the array is sorted, then why does it show a sorted array.
This is because it plays the render calls AFTER the entire sort has taken place!
It doesn't play the render call at that moment in time, rather, it plays whatever values captured at that time are.

SO, since we are only capturing render calls, we end up with the sorted array values at the END of the sort, a sorted array!
