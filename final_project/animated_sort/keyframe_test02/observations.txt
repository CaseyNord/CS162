keyframes seem to capture values AT a specific moment in time,
but when they replay the values they seem to apply those values when they are
replayed.

So in my case, in this example, what we are seeing as an output is all of the values applied as a series of snapshots of array assignments in order, completely desynchronized from the rest of the code...
